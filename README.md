  ## Description
  Have you ever found yourself trying to decide where to go on vacation? Well look no further.  
  Wingit was made for you to simply pick an available flight from your departure city to a destination of your choosing. No extra fuss needed.
  We built this website to help make flight planning easy.  All of our flights are non-stop, meaning a very small chance of having your bags lost or any of that other nonsense that comes with traveling.
  Along the way, we discovered that there are many more feature that we would have liked to have added to have it more in line with a robust travel app.  The main issue we had was with mapping the data from the back end seed files to the front end react page.  
 
  ## Installation
